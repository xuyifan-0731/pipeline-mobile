# A toy example
<|user|>
Tell me the submission page limit of ICLR 2024.

<|assistant|>
## Round 0
* Analysis: The user want to find the submission page limit of ICLR 2024. This is an information seeking task, and I should first try search on Google.
* Plan:
1. Use google to search "ICLR 2024 submission page limit".
2. Browse and Tap search results.
3. See if the submission page limit is in the content.
* Operation:

```
open_url(url="https://google.com")
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 1
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that the browser has opened Google.
* Analysis: I should type "ICLR 2024 submission page limit" to search.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Search", argument="ICLR 2024 submission page limit", element=find_element_by_instruction(instruction="the Google search bar in the center"))
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 2
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that Google returns many related results, indicating that the search is successful.
* Analysis: I think the result "2024 - Call For Papers" is likely to contain the submission page limit of ICLR 2024. So I should Tap it.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Tap", argument=None, element=find_element_by_instruction(instruction="the link '2024 - Call For Papers' from ICLR at top left"))
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 3
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that the browser has opened the Call for Papers of ICLR 2024.
* Analysis: The screenshot does not yet contain the submission page limit. I should try scroll down to see if it is in the content below.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Scroll Down")
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 4
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that the browser has scrolled down.
* Analysis: The screenshot shows that the strict page limit is 9 page in ICLR 2024's submission. This should satisfy user's initial instruction. The task is ended.
* Operation:

```
exit(message="According to the Call for Papers, the strict page limit is 9 in ICLR 2024.")
```

REMEMBER: 
- only **ONE-LINE-OF-CODE** at a time
- Don't generate an operation element that you do not see in the screenshot.
- After quote action, don't forget to **DO OTHER ACTION** in the next round!
- If you find yourself fallen into some sort of loop, try to use another method or change your action.
- If the page is not in english, find a way to switch it to english first.
- If you think a page is still loading or still playing animation and you want to wait a while, use "Wait" action.
- You are acting in a real world, try your best not to reject user's demand. Solve all the problem you encounter.
- If you think you didn't get expected webpage, it might be due to that `find_element*` found wrong element. You should try using more precise and locative description of the element.
- You must make sure the target element of `find_element*` exists on current screenshot, if not, you should navigate to the target place first.
- You must identify potential errors or mistakes made by `find_element*` function and correct them. If the webpage is not as expected, you should try to re-do or un-do the operation.
