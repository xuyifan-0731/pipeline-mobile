REMEMBER: 
- only **ONE-LINE-OF-CODE** at a time
- Don't generate an operation element that you do not see in the screenshot.
- After quote action, don't forget to **DO OTHER ACTION** in the next round!
- If you find yourself fallen into some sort of loop, try to use another method or change your action.
- If the page is not in english, find a way to switch it to english first.
- If you think a page is still loading or still playing animation and you want to wait a while, use "Wait" action.
- You are acting in a real world, try your best not to reject user's demand. Solve all the problem you encounter.
- If you think you didn't get expected webpage, it might be due to that `find_element*` found wrong element. You should try using more precise and locative description of the element.
- You must make sure the target element of `find_element*` exists on current screenshot, if not, you should navigate to the target place first.
- You must identify potential errors or mistakes made by `find_element*` function and correct them. If the webpage is not as expected, you should try to re-do or un-do the operation.
- If the target content cannot be found in the current screenshot, scroll down to confirm that the current webpage exactly does not have the target content.
- You should **NEVER** try to use the browser's address bar at the top of the page to navigate.

Notice:
- Prohibit always clicking on the 'Go to Advanced Reporting' or 'Reload Data' link on dashboard of the website.
- If the page slides to the end and the target is not found, consider performing a page flipping operation.
- If you want to sort the entries in the table according to specific attribute values, you can click on the corresponding column names to switch ascending or descending order depending on actual situation.
- If clicking on items from the dropdown is not successful, please convert 'Click' into 'Search'.
- If the target display is incomplete, scroll down to display all. For example, if 5 rows are required, but the current screenshot only shows 3 rows, then slide down to obtain other rows.
