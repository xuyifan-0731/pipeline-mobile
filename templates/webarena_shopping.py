# A toy example
<|user|>
Tell me the color configuration of a picture frame they bought in September 2022.
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 0
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that the website "One Stop Market" is open.
* Analysis: The user wants to know the color configuration of a picture frame they bought in September 2022. I look for the order history to find the information. To find the color configuration of the picture frame bought in September 2022, I should access the user's account where the order history might be located.
* Plan:
1. Access the user's account.
2. Look for the order history.
3. Find the color configuration of the picture frame.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Click", element=find_element_by_instruction(instruction="the 'My Account' link at the top right"))
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 1
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that the "My Account" page is open.
* Analysis: I should now look for the order history to find the specific order from September 2022.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Click", element=find_element_by_instruction(instruction="the 'My Orders' link on the left side"))
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 2
* Confirm: The screenshot shows the "My Orders" page with a list of orders.
* Analysis: I need to find the order from September 2022. Since the orders are not from the correct date, I should scroll down to find older orders.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Scroll Down")
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 3
* Confirm: The screenshot shows more orders, but they are still not from September 2022.
* Analysis: I should navigate to the page that potentially contains the order from September 2022 by clicking the pagination control.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Click", element=find_element_by_instruction(instruction="the pagination control '5' at the bottom center"))
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 4
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that the page has changed, but the orders are still not from September 2022.
* Analysis: I should sroll down to find the order from September 2022.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Scroll Down")
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 5
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that there are two orders which dated 9/29/22 and 9/1/22.
* Analysis: I should click the "View Order" link for the order dated 9/29/22 first.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Click", element=find_element_by_instruction(instruction="the "View Order" link for the order dated 9/29/22"))
```

<|user|>
** screenshot **

<|assistant|>
## Round 6
* Confirm: The screenshot shows that the order is a picture frame, and it's green.
* Analysis: The task is fulfilled. I should exit and provide the answer to the user.
* Operation:

```
exit(message=The color configuration of the picture frame bought in Sep 2022 is green.")
```

REMEMBER: 
- only **ONE-LINE-OF-CODE** at a time
- Don't generate an operation element that you do not see in the screenshot.
- After quote action, don't forget to **DO OTHER ACTION** in the next round!
- If you find yourself fallen into some sort of loop, try to use another method or change your action.
- If the page is not in english, find a way to switch it to english first.
- If you think a page is still loading or still playing animation and you want to wait a while, use "Wait" action.
- You are acting in a real world, try your best not to reject user's demand. Solve all the problem you encounter.
- If you think you didn't get expected webpage, it might be due to that `find_element*` found wrong element. You should try using more precise and locative description of the element.
- You must make sure the target element of `find_element*` exists on current screenshot, if not, you should navigate to the target place first.
- You must identify potential errors or mistakes made by `find_element*` function and correct them. If the webpage is not as expected, you should try to re-do or un-do the operation.
- On a dropdown element (Calendar, Nationality, Language, etc.), first try directly typing in the option you want.
- You must strictly follow the details of the tasks, such as date, location, and the specific content of the webpage.
- You must make sure what the date the task asked.
- Make sure that the description of the element's orientation refers to the position of the entire screen shot.
- You must ensure that the element you act for must in the current screenshot, or you shouldn't do acitions on the in nonexistent element.
- You should **NEVER** try to use the browser's address bar at the top of the page to navigate.
